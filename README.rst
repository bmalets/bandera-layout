Cyrillic keyboard
=================

For particular reason I don't like to look at *that* flag anymore.
So I hacked my keyboard layout, changed it's name, flag and
added missing Ukrainian-Cyrillic letters to it.

How to use
----------

Copy 'Cyrillic bilingual.bundle' into /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts
and go to language preferences.

Ukrainian-cyrillic keys:

Symbols and letters like: `alt-и` ('і'), `alt-й` or `alt-§` ('ї'), `alt-э` ('є'), alt-е, alt-ц is deleted.
Now it just standart Ukrainian keyboard with UPA flag.

Glory to Ukraine!
Слава Україні!
